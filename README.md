DataOps Platform for AMR Fleet Health &amp; Predictive Maintenance


**The Business Case:** A company operates a fleet of 500 Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in large-scale logistics warehouses. These robots are critical for sorting and moving packages 24/7. When a robot fails unexpectedly on the floor, it causes significant operational delays and revenue loss. The current maintenance plan is reactive (fixing things after they break) or based on simple time-based schedules, which is inefficient.

**The Goal:** To create a data platform that monitors the entire AMR fleet's health in real-time, identifies operational anomalies, and predicts component failures before they happen. The initial focus will be on predicting wheel motor failures, which are a common cause of downtime.
